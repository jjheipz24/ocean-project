            <p>
                The goal of this project is to create an engaginc and educational website to teach about the effects of various types of
                ocean pollution on marine life.
            </p>

            <p>This program features a 2D graphic of the ocean. It has three graphics within it to represent plant life, animal
                life, and us. It also features graphics of trash, oil, and chemicals on the side. The user is able to click and
                drag one of the pollution graphics into the ocean. When this happens, the ocean graphic will change to imply
                the pollution has affected it. Hovering over the three graphics within the ocean, the user is able to click on
                them and an info box appears, explaining how the pollution has affected it. Afterwards, a button appears at the
                bottom of the page which resets the scene.
